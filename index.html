<h1>‚òÖivana del carmen cancer survivor‚òÖ</h1>
20 years old venezuelan who came tu US 3 years ago to study and for a cancer treatmentI started my carrer as a model very young, i dont even remember exactly when because my mom was in the fashion industry since she was 18 and when she got me she stared to put me in baby comercials, photoshoots and catalogs.
<p>At the age of only 3 I was walking in Dior and Chanel's runways and other proyects of venezuelan designers like Angel Sanchez, Carolina Herrera... then when I was 11 all venezuelan designers and celebrities knew about me, well, they knew about Jesica's dauther, not ivana, but anyways i got a lot of different offers for modeling but I didn't like it because I wasn't thinking about work but about play with my friends and other things that kids suppose to do.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, I came to US to take a cancer treatment that in venezuela was unknown. It wasn't a very big deal for me because i knew I was going to be ok, but a lot of people started praying for me and for my health and they began to tell me that i was like a kind of inspiration for them and i was strong even though I didn't feel i was doing thigs to inspire people. That's why I realize that maybe with my social media and my attitude I could inspire people to don't let the difficult times in your life put you down but insted take them as a lesson to learn that we can't control our life and that every moment is important.</p>
